The instant you look behind you, Eva hurries toward the sound and whatever she's chasing squawks like a stuck pig. If she hadn't stopped at a tree, you never would've caught up to her.

Whatever's up there sure pissed her off. A bird, maybe?

Eva's not built for climbing, but that doesn't stop her from trying: she leaps straight up into the air, reaching for the nearest branch.

Way off. Not even close.

You stifle a laugh. If the branch were high above her, that'd be one thing, but it's at her shoulders. She would've bumped into it if she simply stepped forward.

Her second attempt is arguably better. She gets her chin and elbows over the top and hangs on like it's a piece of driftwood in shark infested waters.

You'll give her one thing: she's determined. If you were in her shoes (err, paws), you'd let go as soon you felt yourself slipping. But not her. She keeps kicking like she's almost got it — until she lands on the ground with a dull thud.

With a gasp, she sits up and turns away. Did you— Did she— You cover your mouth to suppress a laugh; her titty fell out. ...maybe? Something jiggled, but she recovered so fast, you didn't catch it.

Without drawing attention to it, she gets up and tries again. At this point, it'd be neglectful to let her continue.


Lift Eva to the branch so she can scare away the varmint.

Poor varmint must be scared to death. Leave her, then make a note to stop saying 'varmint.'`;

She taps her lip. "What kind of treat?"

Nothing comes to mind. "A secret one. But it'll be worth it."

With your arms held out, you step off the rope, and she drops into them.

"Wee!"

Of course that was just a ploy for her own safety; to buy yourself a bit of time, you put her down and untangle the vine around her thighs. Nope. Still couldn't think of anything. "No brain damage. That's your treat."

"That's it?" Eva pouts. "Can I trade for something?"

"All right, fine." Once you hand her a treat, you gently knock on her forehead with your knuckles, but it's hard to tell if she notices. The two of you leave the area.`;
